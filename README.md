# ChatGPT Telegram Bot

* It uses playwright and chromium to open browser and parse html
* It is an unoffical api for development purpose only.
* This wont work over SSH or a Docker image, you need to do this on a desktop environment where X server is available.

# How to install

* Make sure that python and virual environment is installed.

* Create a conda environment with `conda env create -f environment.yml`

* If you are installing playwright for the first time, it will ask you to run this command for one time only to download all the chrome software
```
playwright install
```

You need to setup your telegram bot token [how to](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and [user id](https://bigone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008014894-How-to-get-the-Telegram-user-ID-) in `.env` file.
Edit the .env.example file and rename it to .env and place your values in there. 


* Now run the server

```
python server.py
```

Then find your bot in telegram (you should have already created it with @botfather) and start chatting.
